# DSA-Based-Project

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)-based projects designed to enhance problem-solving skills and understanding of core concepts. Each project tackles a specific problem using advanced algorithms and data structures.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Cash Flow Minimizer (Graphs/Multisets/Heaps)**
   - **Description**: Optimize cash flow among a group of people by minimizing the total number of transactions needed to settle all debts.
   - **Status**: Work in Progress.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Uses **graphs**, **multisets**, and **heaps** to efficiently calculate minimal transactions.
     - Ideal for understanding graph traversal and optimization.
   - **Future Enhancements**:
     - Improve the algorithm’s efficiency.
     - Add a user-friendly interface.

### 2. **Sudoku Solver (Backtracking)**
   - **Description**: Solve Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Handles standard 9x9 Sudoku grids.
     - Demonstrates the power of recursive backtracking for constraint-based problems.
   - **Usage**:
     - Input a Sudoku puzzle with blanks.
     - Obtain a valid solution (if one exists).

### 3. **File Zipper (Greedy Huffman Encoder)**
   - **Description**: Compress files using Huffman encoding.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Implements the **Huffman encoding** algorithm.
     - Achieves a balance between compression ratio and execution time.
     - Great for learning greedy algorithms and tree-based encodings.
   - **Usage**:
     - Provide a file to compress.
     - Retrieve a compressed version and the decompression key.

### 4. **Map Navigator (Dijkstra's Algorithm)**
   - **Description**: Build a navigation system using Dijkstra's algorithm.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Computes the shortest path between two locations.
     - Considers distance and traffic for realistic navigation.
     - Focuses on **Delhi’s map places** for location data.
   - **Usage**:
     - Input the start and end locations.
     - Get the shortest path with additional metrics like distance and traffic delays.
